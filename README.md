## Overview

BidCentral is a full-stack application that simulates an online auction platform. Primary user functionalities include listing items for sale, bidding on existing items, and viewing finished auctions. The app uses Python Flask as a web framework and a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.

This project was created as part of coursework at Georgia Tech. To avoid potential honor code violations, the source code is not included in this repo.
