## Overview

BidCentral is a full-stack application that simulates an online auction platform. Primary user functionalities include listing items for sale, bidding on existing items, and viewing finished auctions. The app uses Python Flask as a web framework and a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.

This project was created as part of coursework at Georgia Tech. To avoid potential honor code violations, the source code is not included in this repo.

### View Item for Sale

An active auction page consists of detailed item information, bid history, and the option for users to bid on the current item. Users may also view ratings for previously completed auctions involving the same item type. Administrators have the additional ability to cancel the auction.
