## Overview

BidCentral is a full-stack application that simulates an online auction platform. Primary user functionalities include listing items for sale, bidding on existing items, and viewing completed auctions. 

This project was created as part of coursework at Georgia Tech. To avoid honor code violations, I am not including the code within this repo. 

## Demo

On launching the application, users may either log in via an existing account or choose to create a new account.
