## Overview

BidCentral is a full-stack application that simulates an online auction platform. Primary user functionalities include listing items for sale, bidding on existing items, and viewing finished auctions. The app uses Python Flask as a web framework and a PostgreSQL database for storage. 

This project was created as part of coursework at Georgia Tech. To avoid potential honor code violations, the code is excluded from this repo.
